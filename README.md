# TitrationModel
Collaborators: Catherine Wijaya & Amy Kuang

This is a model of an acid-base titration.
We will have a starting screen where if you click the screen with the mouse, it will take you to the another screen that starts the simulation. Also, if you wait too long, then it will automatically go to the next screen.
The next scene will be where you can choose the specific experiment combination of acids and base, and we will animate the pouring of the indicator and the titrand to a beaker. Next, you will see a buret and the beaker. You will be able to select how you want the titrant to drip down into the beaker: how fast or slow it goes. Here, you will also see a table of the pH, how many milliliters of titrant and titrand there is. As the titrant is dripping, you will also be able to see the color of the solution in the beaker changing. The objective is to stop the dripping at the right time, when the solution turns another color and stays there. Then you will find the equivalence point.
To start animating the dripping, press enter.
